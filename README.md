# File_Sharing_With_QR_Codes




In the digital age, efficient and user-friendly methods for sharing files and information across devices on a local network are highly sought after. This project presents a solution by leveraging Python's built-in networking capabilities to create a local HTTP server that hosts files directly from the user's desktop. The server can be accessed through any web browser, making it convenient for file sharing without the need for third-party applications.

The project utilizes Python modules such as `http.server` for setting up the server, `socket` for determining the local machine's IP address, and `pyqrcode` to generate QR codes for easy server access. By scanning the QR code, users can instantly connect to the server, enhancing accessibility and reducing the need for manual IP entry.

This approach not only simplifies file sharing within local networks but also serves as an educational example of how Python can be used to build lightweight, yet powerful, networking applications. The project demonstrates a practical implementation of a local server that integrates network programming and quick response (QR) code technology for an improved user experience.ile sharing for small-scale, on-the-fly use cases.







This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a lightweight, local HTTP file server using Python. By leveraging standard libraries and minimal third-party dependencies, it provides a simple and effective solution for sharing files across devices on the same network. The addition of a dynamically generated QR code makes the server more accessible, particularly for non-technical users.
