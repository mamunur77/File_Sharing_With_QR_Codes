# File_Sharing_With_QR_Codes


Introduction

In the digital age, efficient and user-friendly methods for sharing files and information across devices on a local network are highly sought after. This project presents a solution by leveraging Python's built-in networking capabilities to create a local HTTP server that hosts files directly from the user's desktop. The server can be accessed through any web browser, making it convenient for file sharing without the need for third-party applications.

The project utilizes Python modules such as `http.server` for setting up the server, `socket` for determining the local machine's IP address, and `pyqrcode` to generate QR codes for easy server access. By scanning the QR code, users can instantly connect to the server, enhancing accessibility and reducing the need for manual IP entry.

This approach not only simplifies file sharing within local networks but also serves as an educational example of how Python can be used to build lightweight, yet powerful, networking applications. The project demonstrates a practical implementation of a local server that integrates network programming and quick response (QR) code technology for an improved user experience.ile sharing for small-scale, on-the-fly use cases.

 
Problem Statement:

In today's interconnected world, sharing files quickly and seamlessly across devices within a local network can be a challenge, especially when users rely on external storage devices, cloud services, or complex file transfer protocols. Many of these solutions require internet access, user accounts, or additional software installations, which may not be ideal in scenarios where network security, speed, and ease of use are priorities.

The problem addressed by this project is the lack of a straightforward, lightweight solution for sharing files directly over a local network without requiring additional software or internet connectivity. This becomes particularly relevant in environments like small offices, classrooms, or home networks where users need to share files across multiple devices quickly and securely.

The project provides a solution by setting up a local HTTP server that hosts files from the user's desktop, allowing other devices on the same network to access these files using a web browser. Additionally, by generating a QR code that links directly to the server, this project simplifies the process of connecting to the server, eliminating the need to manually enter IP addresses. This approach enhances user convenience, reduces the reliance on third-party tools, and leverages the capabilities of built-in Python libraries for efficient network file sharing. 
Literature Review
Local file sharing and server setup have been widely explored in various fields, focusing on efficiency, accessibility, and ease of deployment. Traditional methods for file sharing often rely on FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMB (Server Message Block), or cloud-based solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox. However, these methods either require complex configurations, user accounts, or consistent internet access, which may not be feasible in all scenarios.

Traditional methods for file sharing often rely on FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMB (Server Message Block), or cloud-based solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox. However, these methods either require complex configurations, user accounts, or consistent internet access, which may not be feasible in all scenarios.

A)   HTTP Servers for Local Networks:
•	Researchers have extensively utilized Python's http.server module to create lightweight web servers for local networks. This approach has been praised for its simplicity, as it requires no additional software installations beyond Python itself. Studies have shown that using HTTP servers for file sharing can significantly reduce setup complexity compared to traditional FTP or SMB solutions.

•	For instance, projects like "Python SimpleHTTPServer" demonstrate how small-scale servers can be rapidly deployed for sharing files within local networks. However, these projects often lack user-friendly features like automatic URL generation or QR code access.


B) QR Code Integration in Networking:
•	QR codes have been widely adopted for sharing URLs and network configurations due to their ease of use and accessibility. Research has explored using QR codes to connect devices to Wi-Fi networks or share contact information. The integration of QR codes for accessing local servers is less common, but it has shown potential in improving user experience by eliminating the need for manual IP address entry.

•	Similar projects have used QR codes to link users directly to web applications or shared resources, streamlining access in environments like conferences and workshops. However, many of these implementations are focused on internet-based access rather than local file sharing.

C) Local Network Sharing without Internet:
•	Projects like "Wi-Fi Direct" and "ShareIt" have explored peer-to-peer file sharing without relying on external networks. These solutions highlight the need for efficient local sharing, particularly in offline environments. However, they often require dedicated applications or custom protocols, making them less accessible for quick, ad-hoc file sharing.

•	The combination of Python's built-in networking capabilities with modern accessibility features like QR codes is relatively unexplored, especially in open-source and educational contexts.
 
2.Highlighting Gaps in Current Research or Technology

•	Lack of Integration Between Local Servers and QR Code Accessibility: While there are many solutions for setting up local HTTP servers, they often require users to manually enter IP addresses to access the server, which can be cumbersome. Existing research has not fully explored integrating QR codes with local servers to simplify access.

•	Dependence on Internet or Specialized Applications: Many current file-sharing solutions depend on internet access or proprietary applications, which may not be feasible in offline or restricted network environments.

•	Limited Focus on User-Friendly, Lightweight Solutions: Existing projects focus on either complex setups or require additional software, leaving a gap for a lightweight, easy-to-implement solution using readily available tools and technologies.
 
Methodology 

1.Design and Framework:
The project is designed to function as a local file server that enables users to serve and access files from a specified directory (in this case, the "M:\WALLPAPER" folder).
a.	HTTP Server:
o	The project leverages Python's built-in http.server module to create an HTTP server, which is sufficient for serving static files locally.
b.	Local Network Discovery:
o	The socket library is used to determine the machine's local IP address dynamically, ensuring that the server URL is accessible to devices on the same local network.
c.	Ease of Access:
o	The project generates a QR code using the pyqrcode library to simplify access for mobile devices or other clients. Scanning the QR code directs the user to the server's URL.
d.	User Interaction:
o	A web browser is automatically opened to display the generated QR code (server_link.svg), ensuring users can quickly start interacting with the server.
Execution Model
•	Single-threaded server: The project uses Python’s socketserver.TCPServer, which is suitable for lightweight local hosting. This model is synchronous, meaning it handles one request at a time.
•	Static file serving: The HTTP server serves files from the M:\WALLPAPER directory, making it ideal for sharing images or other files in a specific folder.

The framework is lightweight, making use of Python's built-in libraries, enhanced by external libraries (pyqrcode and png) for convenience. This approach is ideal for local or small-scale file sharing and testing purposes.


2.Tools and Technologies

•	Cross-platform compatibility for serving files and generating QR codes.
•	A user-friendly interface for accessing the server via browser or QR code.
This makes the project a practical solution for sharing files locally without complex configurations.
 
3.Data Collection and Analysis:
Sources of Data
•	Directory Contents:
o	The server serves files directly from the specified directory (M:\WALLPAPER).
o	Any files or subfolders present in the specified folder are automatically made accessible to users via the server.
Data Cleaning
•	The project assumes that the files in the directory are already organized and relevant. There is no explicit step in the code to filter or clean files before serving them. However:
o	The http.server module excludes system files (e.g., hidden files) that do not conform to HTTP standards, ensuring only standard files are accessible.
o	Users are responsible for ensuring the folder contains only the desired content to be shared.
Preprocessing
•	File Path Configuration:
o	The working directory is explicitly set using os.chdir(r"M:\WALLPAPER"). This ensures the server knows where to look for files.
o	Subdirectories and file types are served as-is without modification or conversion.
•	Dynamic URL Creation:
o	The local IP address and port number are dynamically discovered using socket. This ensures that the generated URL accurately reflects the host machine's current network configuration.
•	QR Code Generation:
o	The URL for accessing the server is preprocessed into a QR code format (server_link.svg and server_link.png) using the pyqrcode library. This simplifies access for users on other devices.
Analytical Techniques
•	While no explicit analytical techniques are applied, the project supports basic server monitoring through the console logs:
o	The server prints messages indicating when it starts and provides the URL for access.
o	Additional monitoring (e.g., tracking file requests) could be implemented by extending the http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler class to log detailed request data.
